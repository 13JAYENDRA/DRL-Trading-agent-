This project implements a **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent** designed to trade stocks autonomously in a simulated environment. The agent leverages historical market data to learn optimal trading strategies, aiming to **maximize profit while minimizing risk**. This project combines reinforcement learning algorithms, financial modeling, and data visualization to create an intelligent trading system.


## Features

* **DRL Algorithms Implemented**: DQN, DDQN, PPO (depending on your implementation)
* **Custom Trading Environment**: Built using OpenAI Gym interface with realistic stock trading constraints
* **Data Handling**: Fetches historical stock data from MySQL or CSV datasets
* **Reward System**: Designed to balance profit, risk, and transaction costs
* **Performance Visualization**: Plots portfolio value, actions taken, and rewards over time
* **Backtesting**: Evaluates the agent on unseen data to assess strategy effectiveness


## Project Motivation

Stock trading is a complex sequential decision-making problem influenced by market volatility. Traditional algorithms rely heavily on human intuition and technical indicators, which can be inefficient. This project demonstrates how **Deep Reinforcement Learning** can autonomously learn profitable strategies from raw data, enabling more adaptive and intelligent trading.


## Methodology

1. **Environment Setup**:

   * Simulates stock trading using OpenAI Gym-like interface
   * Includes features like buy, sell, hold actions, transaction fees, and portfolio constraints

2. **Data Preprocessing**:

   * Historical stock prices are normalized and structured for training
   * Features include OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) and technical indicators

3. **Agent Design**:

   * DRL agent interacts with the environment to learn optimal actions
   * Uses neural networks to approximate Q-values or policy functions

4. **Training Loop**:

   * Episodes represent trading over a fixed historical period
   * Agent receives rewards based on portfolio performance
   * Experience replay and target networks are used (for DQN/DDQN)

5. **Evaluation**:

   * Tracks cumulative rewards, portfolio growth, and transaction efficiency
   * Visualizes trading decisions to interpret agent behavior

## Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **Libraries**: TensorFlow / PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenAI Gym
* **Database**: MySQL (for storing historical stock data)
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization
